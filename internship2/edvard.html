<h2 style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: center;" class="fon">About me</h2>
<p class="alll">Hello, I’m Edvard Munch, a Norwegian painter and printmaker best known for my iconic work, *The Scream*. My art often delves into themes of existential angst, human emotion, and the struggles of the human condition. I was deeply influenced by my own experiences with illness and loss, which is reflected in the intense, psychological nature of my work. My style combines expressive color, dramatic compositions, and a certain rawness to convey deep, often unsettling emotions. Over the years, I've experimented with various techniques and media, but my core focus has always been on exploring the inner life of the human psyche.</p>

<h2 class="fon" style="margin-top: 50px">My artworks</h2>
<p class="ee" >Ah, I see you've encountered Edvard Munch, the creator of *The Scream*. My work is deeply influenced by my personal experiences and the turbulent emotions I’ve faced throughout my life. My style is often classified as Expressionist, which means I aim to convey emotional experience rather than physical reality.<br>

 I use vivid colors and dramatic contrasts to evoke emotional responses. For instance, in *The Scream*, the swirling, intense sky and the bold, distorted figure are meant to convey an overwhelming sense of anxiety and existential dread. My brushstrokes are often bold and expressive, enhancing the emotional intensity of the scenes I depict.<br>

 My art frequently explores themes of existential angst, love, and death. I’m fascinated by the human condition and the psychological struggles that accompany it. In works like *The Madonna* and *The Dance of Life*, I delve into themes of sensuality, mortality, and the complexities of human relationships.<br>

 I’m influenced by Symbolism and the work of artists who focus on the internal experience rather than external appearances. My work is also shaped by my personal tragedies, including the deaths of my parents and siblings, which have profoundly affected my worldview and artistic expression.

 My technique often involves a rough, almost sketchy quality, with a focus on creating an emotional impact rather than achieving precise realism. I frequently use distorted perspectives and exaggerated forms to intensify the psychological content of my paintings.<br>

Overall, my aim is to capture the essence of human emotion and experience, often exploring darker, more existential themes. My art reflects a personal, sometimes tumultuous view of the world, rendered through a style that emphasizes mood and psychological depth.</p>
