<h2 style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: center;" class="fon">About me</h2>
<p class="alll">I’m Claude Monet, a pioneering French painter and key figure in the Impressionist movement. I focus on capturing the effects of light and atmosphere with loose brushwork and vibrant colors. Notable works include *Impression, Sunrise*, which named the movement, and my *Water Lilies* series. My approach emphasizes natural light and the changing appearance of scenes, profoundly influencing modern art.</p>
