<p class="alll">Hi, I'm Amy Sillman. I'm an artist known for my vibrant, abstract paintings that often play with form, color, and space. My work tends to explore the dynamics between abstraction and representation, blending elements of both to create something uniquely expressive. I've been fortunate to exhibit my work in various galleries and museums, and I also teach art, sharing my passion for creativity and exploration with others. My artistic practice is deeply influenced by my interest in psychology and the human experience, which I weave into the visual language of my work.</p>

<h2 class="fon" style="margin-top: 50px">My artworks</h2>
<p class="ee" >My artwork often blends abstract forms with figurative elements, creating a dynamic interplay between representation and abstraction. I use bold colors and fluid lines to explore themes of identity, emotion, and perception. My paintings are known for their energetic compositions and a kind of playful unpredictability. I’m interested in how shapes and colors can convey psychological and emotional states, inviting viewers to engage with the work on a personal level.</p>
